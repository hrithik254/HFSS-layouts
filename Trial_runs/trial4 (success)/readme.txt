from 20th December to 29th December I tried to correct my simulations.
1) In trial 3 I have simulated a very small length.
2) As I increased the length to 2.5 mm the S parameters went haywire

I had to
1) Increase the air box dimensios.
2) It turns out of you do not assign radiation boundary the whole box resonates like a microwave
3) The back ground plane adds a parasitic parallel plate capacitor or microstrip mode.
4) You need to place air bridges at lambda/8 to ensure that the odd mode or the Coupled Slotline modes (CSL) do not get excited.
5) I still need to deal with the backside ground issue. What to do etc. I still need to simulate it and see how it is affecting the results. All in all I have successfully simulated. I have documented the 8 days process in the word file.
